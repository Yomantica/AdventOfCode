# Advent of Code

In this repository I post my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) advent calendar.
I don't compete for global leaderboards, but try to learn as much of a language as I can.
Hence, you might find code here that may look like someone else's as I take inspiration from others to solve the issue
using (to me) new concepts. So this is also not necessarily the code that I solved the puzzle with ðŸ˜‰.
